# 2D Platformer Draft Project
A 2D Unity Platformer game project used to practice my coding skills and learn more about Unity.
This game is a demo, so it only has player movement, some enemies to test, and an empty white wall sprite to test around.
This is not a main project; it is mostly used as a draft project to either test things that I learned or learn more about different ways of coding, the Unity engine, and 2D physics.


Basic player control:
- A and LeftArrow: Moving Left
- D and RightArrow: Moving Right
- W and Space: jumping
- J and Z: attacking
- L: rolling
- K: Blocking
